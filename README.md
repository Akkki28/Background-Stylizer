# Background-Stylizer
Built a model that stylizes the background of an image cropping out the person in it using Neural Style transfer and semantic segmentaion techniques
given two images,one content,one style, the model outputs the following

Neural style transfer (NST) refers to a class of software algorithms that manipulate digital images, or videos, in order to adopt the appearance or visual style of another image This project utilizes a TensorFlow Hub model for Neural Style Transfer, enabling efficient image manipulation through pre-trained weights and optimized code.
